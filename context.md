- Deployment instructions

---

## F. Hackathon Readiness Assessment (Agents Assemble / DevPost)

### Strongest Differentiators
1. **Offline-first**: Real incident reporting without internet — critical for field workers in low-connectivity Kenya
2. **Trauma-informed design**: Safety gate, Quick Exit, anonymity, consent — built into the architecture
3. **Full case management workflow**: Not just reporting — assignment, PFA, escalation, resolution
4. **Privacy by design**: No PII in exports, role-based visibility, anonymized analytics
5. **Real email notifications**: Automated alerts at every workflow stage
6. **PWA with native-like experience**: Installable, cached, push-ready

### AI Components Status
- **Currently Present**: None. Zero AI code exists in the codebase.
- **Missing for Demo**: AI-powered referral matching (the headline feature for Agents Assemble)

### What Should Be Demoed Live
1. Full anonymous reporting flow (safety gate → form → success)
2. Quick Exit button behavior
3. Offline submission + sync when reconnected
4. Staff workflow: assign counselor → update status → escalate
5. Reports dashboard with real data
6. **AI referral recommendation (if built) with human approval step**

### What Judges Will Likely Question
1. **"Where is the AI agent?"** — Must have a clear AI component
2. **"How does the referral matching work?"** — Need a working demo
3. **"What happens if AI gets it wrong?"** — Human oversight answer is strong
4. **"How do you protect survivor data?"** — Strong answer already (anonymization, RBAC, no PII exports)
5. **"Is this actually deployed/usable?"** — Yes, it's a working PWA

### Risks/Red Flags
- ⚠️ **No AI yet**: For "Agents Assemble" specifically, this is a critical gap. The hackathon is about AI agents
- ⚠️ **New categories not reflected everywhere**: Could show inconsistencies during demo
- ⚠️ **Email requires configuration**: Won't work in demo unless secrets are set

---

## G. Recommended Demo Narrative

> "We built a trauma-informed, offline-first incident reporting platform for youth protection workers in Kenya. The AI layer acts as a referral assistant — when a case is logged, it analyzes the incident type, severity, and location to recommend verified local services. But critically, no AI recommendation reaches a survivor without a trained counselor approving it first. The system prioritizes safety over speed."

---

## H. Recommended Next Actions

### Immediately (Today):
1. **Fix label maps and email templates** for new categories (prevents demo bugs)
2. **Export code from Hercules** (Business license → Download App Code + Export Database)

### Before Submission (Critical):
1. **Build AI referral matching** using Hercules AI Gateway + services database — **mandatory hackathon differentiator**
2. **Add anonymous status lookup page** so reporters can check their case

### For Polish:
1. **Add English/Swahili toggle** (demonstrates real-world readiness)
2. **Create services database** with verified health facilities, police stations, legal aid (from docs/GBV REFERRAL PATHWAY.docx)

---

## I. Technical Risks
1. **No AI infrastructure**: Zero AI code exists. This is the single biggest gap vs. the concept note
2. **Label maps in reports/dashboard not updated**: The new categories (child_exploitation, tech_enabled_abuse) are not reflected in `src/pages/reports/page.tsx` or `src/pages/app/dashboard/page.tsx` label maps
3. **Email template labels outdated**: `convex/emails.ts` still uses old category labels
4. **No services/resources table**: Required before any referral matching can work

---

## J. UX/Safety Risks
1. **No language toggle**: Users in multilingual contexts cannot switch languages
2. **No "safe browsing" mode**: Beyond Quick Exit, no disguised mode or panic key
3. **No follow-up mechanism for anonymous reporters**: They get a reference code but no way to check status

---

## K. FHIR Integration Context (Agents Assemble)

### Why Agents Assemble is the Right Choice:
1. **Healthcare Alignment** – Challenge focuses on FHIR-compliant healthcare systems and interoperability. Aligns with Kenya's MoH FHIR adoption for UHC (2024-2025)
2. **Realistic Timeline** – 8 weeks (until May 11 / July 2, 2026) vs. tight Gemini timeline
3. **Better for GBV Work** – Judges evaluate "Feasibility" and "Impact" on healthcare systems. Directly addresses Kenya's KES 46 billion annual SGBV cost
4. **Proper Testing & Validation** – Space to build properly and test with real user scenarios (critical for survivor data safety)
5. **No High Upfront Costs** – Uses open-source tools vs. Gemini's Google Cloud prepaid credit requirement

### FHIR Resources to Implement:
- `Patient` (survivor - anonymized)
- `Observation` (abuse type, incident details)
- `Location` (health facilities, services)
- `ServiceRequest` (referrals)
- `Consent` (survivor consent records)

### Kenya MoH Integration Points:
- National SGBV FHIR profiles
- Kenya Health Information Exchange (HIE)
- Kakamega & Vihiga county health facilities (from docs/GBV REFERRAL PATHWAY.docx)
